## Overview of Project
Louise, a playwright, is planning a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play Fever. Louise has an estimate of $10,000 for her play's budget, this is her first fundraising campaign and she is requesting some assitance! In analyzing the provided data further, I will assist Louise in visualizing all the different factors that affect a campaign's level of success.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze the data provided regarding different campaigns, launch dates, and their funding goals. This was done to assist Louise in visualizing the process of campaigning, as well as seeing which factors play the most important roles in deciding whether a project's campaign will be successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To perform the analysis, I began by organizing the data set as it was quite large with over 4000 campaigns. I applied a filter to many categories which helped see the data more clearly based on type of campaign (we were primarily looking at play campaigns since that relates most to Louise's), outcomes (successful, failed, canceled, live), goal, pledged, launch date, and other factors. I used a pivot table to make a chart displaying therater outcomes based on launch date. Then, a line chart was made to display the outcomes based on campaign goal. A bar chart was made based on parent category "theater"

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In analyzing the data, we found that theater campaigns launched in May had the highest success rates,while theater productions launched in December had the least successful outcomes. There were very little theater canceled theater productions. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After making a line chart, we found that plays with the fundraising goals of 25000-29999 and 45000-49999 had the most successful outcomes. Failed plays had an opposite outcome compared to percentage of successful plays based on funding goal. There were no canceled plays. This shows that Louise's play Fever will likely not be canceled and that it may have a high success rate as the plays category is mostly successful in reaching pledge goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Not many challenges were encountered while analyzing this data set, one challenge was understanding the meaning of projections made by charts and pivot tables as we are working with a large data set which can make it difficult to apply it to Louise's specific situation. Once we understood which categories are most important to weigh in, the analysis became simpler and more clear. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In analyzing the data, we found that theater campaigns launched in May had the highest success rates,while theater productions launched in December had the least successful outcomes. Therefore, it may be wise for Louise to begin her fundraising campain near May to likely receive the most successful outcome. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

After making a line chart, we found that plays with the fundraising goals of 25000-29999 and 45000-49999 had the most successful outcomes. Failed plays had an opposite outcome compared to percentage of successful plays based on funding goal. There were no canceled plays. This shows that Louise's play Fever will likely not be canceled and that it may have a high success rate as the plays category is mostly successful in reaching pledge goals. This also shows that it may good for Louise to raise her fundraising goal to one of the ranges stated above, whichever is most suitable for the play. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

I found that it might be useful to find which plays are most similar in genre to Louise's Fever, which I'm not sure is easily doable using the tools provided. This may help us see more detailed and accurate outcomes to better help Louise begin her campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In regards to finding plays similar to Louise's Fever, it would be useful to make a pivot table collecting similar keywords found in Fever's description compared to other plays, and visualizing their specific outcomes.
